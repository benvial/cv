  abstract       = {In recent years, technological advances in nanofabrication have opened up new applications in the field of nanophotonics. To engineer and develop novel functionalities, rigorous and efficient numerical methods are required. In parallel, tremendous advances in algorithmic differentiation, in part pushed by the intensive development of machine learning and artificial intelligence, has made possible large-scale optimization of devices with a few extra modifications of the underlying code. We present here our development of three different software libraries for solving Maxwell&rsquo;s equations in various contexts: a finite element code with a high-level interface for problems commonly encountered in photonics, an implementation of the Fourier modal method for multilayered bi-periodic metasurfaces and a plane wave expansion method for the calculation of band diagrams in two-dimensional photonic crystals. All of them are endowed with automatic differentiation capabilities and we present typical inverse design examples.},

  abstract = {The design of photonic devices is usually done through analytical modeling or variation in geometry and material parameters to obtain the required functionalities. Here, we report the use of topology optimization to obtain a bi-focal lens that concentrates the electromagnetic field at different spatial positions depending on the wavelength. Numerical inverse design is carried out to obtain the permittivity layout, satisfying this objective. The resulting device is then 3D printed using two low-loss dielectrics, and experimental field mapping at microwaves demonstrates the ability to enhance the field locally at distinct locations for two separate frequencies.},

We detail the systematic design of electromagnetic metamaterials composed of dielectric inclusions in a ferroelectric matrix that, under an applied voltage, present an optimized effective tunability higher than the bulk due to a nonlinear local electric field enhancement. The effect of volume fraction, losses, and biasing field on homogenized properties is investigated and the analysis of the photonic band diagram is carried out, providing the frequency dependence of the anisotropic effective index and tunability. Such metaceramics can be used in microwave antennas and components with higher reconfigurability and reduced power consumption.},

These structures can be used as resonant reflection bandcut spectral filters that are independent of the polarization and direction of incidence. We show that this resonant reflection dip is due to the excitation of quasimodes (modes associated with a complex frequency) leading to quasi-total absorption. We have fabricated large area samples made of chromium nanorod gratings on top of Si/Cr layers deposited on silicon substrate. Measurements by Fourier transform spectrophotometry show good agreement with finite element simulations. A quasimodal expansion method is applied to obtain a minimal resonant model that fits well full wave simulations and that highlights excitation conditions of the modes.},

  abstract      = {High-frequency homogenization is used to study dispersive media, containing inclusions placed periodically, for which the properties of the material depend on the frequency (Lorentz or Drude model with damping, for example). Effective properties are obtained near a given point of the dispersion diagram in frequency-wavenumber space. The asymptotic approximations of the dispersion diagrams, and the wavefields, so obtained are then cross-validated via detailed comparison with finite element method simulations in both one and two dimensions.},
