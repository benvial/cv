\textbf{Object:} Application to the post of Lecturer in Quantum and Terahertz Experimental Electronic
Systems (Teaching and Research)\\[1.5em]

Dear Professor Uhlig,\\[1em]


I am pleased to attach my CV and research plan for the post of
Lecturer in Quantum and Terahertz Experimental Electronic
Systems as advertised on the jobs.qmul.ac.uk website.

For the past seven years I have held the post of Postdoctoral Research
Assistant in the Antennas and Electromagnetics reseach group in
the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science
at Queen Mary University of London, where my research
has focused primarily on Applied Electromagnetism and Microwave, Millimetrewave
and Terahertz Engineering.

I have a particular interest in microwave and THz technologies
for applications in sensing and communication, with an emphasis on numerical
modelling and inverse design tools.

I have published widely in the field of Optics, Photonics
and Microwave Engineering.
My PhD thesis, “Study of open electromagnetic resonators by modal appoach. 
Application to to infrared multispectral filtering” won two national awards in 2014, and
our recent paper "High frequency meta-ferroelectrics by inverse design" was selected
in the \textit{\href{https://www.osapublishing.org/spotlight/summary.cfm?id=450295}{Spotlight on Optics}}
from the Otical society of America.


% TEACHING
%  quantuum computing, modern technologies for teaching/coding/interactivity
% co-supervision and help for PhD students during my PDRA experience
%  opensource science and codes / didctic examples -> good pedagogy
% RESEARCH
% plans!!
%   - THz (cf new TDS), biological, tunable, sensing, metamaterials
%   - ML with applicarion in antennas and EM
%   - integration / collabs with industry
%   - securing fundings

During my postdoctoral experience in QMUL, I had the
opportunity to work on numerous grant applications in collaboration with Prof
Yang Hao, which led to succesful funding by the EPSRC of several major projects
for a total of around £2.3M and fruitful collaborations with research institutions
and industries accross the UK.
% aotomat:  	935,611
% animate 1,331,529

I am currently working on the \textit{\href{https://animate-research.com/}{ANIMATE project}},
a collaboration with the School of Engineering and Material science in QMUL,
where my research focuses on developing innovative metamaterials and
numerical models for tunable electromagnetic devices.
The cross-disciplinary approach adopted is very stimulating and aims to
pursue an end-to-end research, from modelling and material processing to
functional devices. In this context, I have worked on the THz time
domain spectroscopy measurements of ferroelectric thin films and microstructures,
as well as graphene-based samples with our industrial partners, for reconfigurable
antenna applications.


% researching the history of the great planter families
% in Tortuga in the early nineteenth century and their links with the
% Haitian Revolution, for which I have been awarded a two year grant
% from the Arts and Humanities Research Council. My enquiry focuses
% on the transition from autocratic and feudal structures to democratic
% institutions in the French Atlantic and the cultural barriers to democracy
% in post-colonial societies. It examines transatlantic family structures
% and their influence on French and Colonial political life. I have been
% fortunate to spend a six month sabbatical at the Universite d’Etat d’Haiti
% where I was able to conduct primary research with officials in the Haitian
% government and the United Nations. This has resulted in a six month
% consultancy project from the Haitian Ministry of Social Justice to advise
% on electoral reform.
%
I believe my research has clear links with the Antenna and Electromagnetics 
group and would contribute well to the school's degrees for example 
the BEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering or the 
the MSc Telecommunication and Wireless Systems or Electronic Engineering by Research.

Having discussed my research interests with Prof Parini and Dr Donnan,
I was impressed by the close integration of research and teaching in
the department. I am passionate about the value of integrating doctoral
research into undergraduate teaching have led and supervised two projects for
master students during my PhD in Institut Fresnel in collaboration
with research groups in the and \'Ecole Centrale Marseille, and have helped supervise 
PhD students during my postdoctoral experience in QMUL.

I have taught the module of Quantum programming in 2019 with Dr Robert Donnan and 
Dr Theo Kreouzis, which was an exciting opportunity as it was the first year it 
was set up. I focused on giving tutorials and hands-on programming 
classes on features unique to quantum computing, using interactive web-based notebooks 
to bridge the gap between theory and practical code.

%
% I am also impressed by the strength of your e-learning platforms and
% believe I can help develop these further. As placement officer for the
% year abroad I extended our e-learning resources to provide support
% from Language Assistants to students during their second year
% overseas. This received excellent feedback in our departmental
% Student Experience Survey.
%
% I currently teach undergraduate modules on French Atlantic History
% 1790 – 1840 and The Haitian Revolution and its Links to French
% Political Life and can also offer both undergraduate and postgraduate
% modules on Twentieth Century French Caribbean Politics, Francophone
% Slave Literature and French Caribbean Language and Dialects. I currently
% supervise three PhD students and have seen two of my PhD students
% receive their awards this year.
%
% In addition to my teaching and supervision duties, I serve on the Staff
% Student Liaison Group. From 2009 - 2011 I acted as Undergraduate
% Admissions Tutor for the department; a period which saw an 8\% rise
% in applications at a time when applications nationally dipped by 5\%.
% This was achieved by implementing a new schools outreach programme
% and improving communications with prospective students at the
% post-offer stage.
%
% As associate editor of the ‘French Atlantic Political Review’ I have
% organised a number of conferences. This included a conference on
% ‘Electoral Reform in the French Caribbean’ in Haiti in April which was
% attended by 350 delegates and where I was one of the keynote speakers.

In summary, I believe my relevant expertise in Electromagnetism,
THz and numerical analysis, my strong research and publications record, my
ability to support the school’s degree programmes and my
experience in teaching Quantum coding whilst improving the
student experience make me ideally placed to contribute in this 
Lecturer position.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further at
interview. Please contact me if you would like any further information
in the meantime.




% I am writing to apply for the postdoctoral position ``The Quest for Ultimate Electromagnetics using Spatial Transformations (QUEST)''
% as an answer to the call
% found on \emph{Queen Mary University} website. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at \emph{Institut Fresnel} (Marseille,
% France) under the direction of Dr. Nicolas Bonod, and fully completed my PhD in last April. I am
% extremely interested in obtaining a position in your \emph{Antennas and Electromagnetics research group}, as its
% electromagnetics research programs have a stellar reputation that is
% known worldwide.
%
% I believe that my engineering/master degree at \emph{\'Ecole Centrale Marseille}
% followed by three years of PhD, in academia at
% \emph{Institut Fresnel} under the direction of Prof. Mireille Commandr\'e
% and in industry at \emph{Silios Technologies} under the direction of Dr. St\'ephane Tisserand,
% prepare me to be an effective researcher in
% your group and more specifically on this project. During my PhD, I have developed in collaboration with the CLARTE team
% (Pr. Fr\'ed\'eric Zolla and Pr. Andr\'e Nicolet)
% a systematic approach based on the Finite Element Method
% to study resonances in bi-periodic open electromagnetic structures,
% \textit{i.e.} finding complex eigenfrequencies and leaky eigenmodes
% of Maxwell's operator. Through a geometrical
% transformation of space, our method allows to treat a bounded problem where the free space is truncated by
% Perfectly Matched Layers (PML).
% The main advantage of this method is its complete generality with
% respect to the studied geometries and the material properties.
% In addition, I have developed adaptive PMLs (APMLs) with an \textit{ad hoc} transformation of coordinate
%  to treat the case of Wood's anomalies
% for which the classical PMLs become ineffective when dealing with the diffraction of a plane wave by a grating.
% I also developed a technique to study the conditions of excitation of the modes of the periodic and non periodic structures.
% By expanding an electromagnetic field solution of Maxwell's equations with sources on the eigenmode basis,
% the method reveals the relative importance of the different photonic states in the scattering process.
% I successfully applied these methods to find a set of opto-geometrical parameters
% for crossed-gratings that realize different filtering functions in the thermal infrared.
%  Finally, I supervised the fabrication of these nano-structures
% including vacuum evaporation deposition and photolithography processes
% and I characterized the samples experimentally on a dedicated set up using a Fourier Transform InfaRed (FTIR)
% spectrophotometer.
%
% Although my dissertation focuses on a specific concrete application,
% other areas that interest me for my future research stem from my
% goal of developing improved analytical and numerical models and methods for the
% design and physical characterization of nanophotonic and transformation optics
% devices. The numerical tools I developed during my PhD are not limited to periodic structures, and
% the eigenmode expansion method can straightforwardly compute Green functions and Local Density of States in
% complex nanostructured environments. In the framework of my current postdoc,
% I am applying these techniques to the study of resonant interactions
% of light with nanoparticles.
%
% The codes I have developed so far were based on commercial software (Matlab/Comsol), but I am
% working on an open source version using Python/Gmsh/GetDP.
% I occupied for six month a postdoctoral position aiming at using Hamiltonian optics to compute ray trajectories in
% media with arbitrary index repartition, but also to treat the inverse problem of finding index distribution to make light follow
% a prescribed path. The project finally deals with deshomogenization technique to find slowly varying photonic crystal parameters
% that approximates the required index distribution.
%
%
%
% % I believe that modal analysis is of great importance in nanophotonics
% % for the study of electromagnetic resonances and that it constitutes a
% % fundamental point of view for engineering the flow of light in nanomaterials. The spectral approach
% % I can provide on this project on solid state lighting can readily be used
% % to tune the emission spectra of photonic resonators, to shape their emission pattern or
% % to optimize absorption in those structures.
% % to tune the emission spectra, to shape its pattern, optimize aborption in
% % and control the local density of states in nanomaterials.
% % I was also involved
% % in the modeling of Haroche's Quantum ElectroDynamic cavity, in
% % partnership with the CLARTE team, to find its leaky modes and estimates the lifetime of photons
% % in such a high quality factor open resonator.
%
% % During my graduate training and in spite of my specific CIFRE PhD
% % status, I have been fortunate enough to instruct for MS student internships.
% %My five years of professional experience as an
% %engineer have provided me with a broad view that is useful in
% %assisting students with projects and assignments.
% %Through my participation as a teaching assistant, I have developed
% %confidence and an interest in teaching and look forward to the
% %opportunity to both teach assigned classes and to develop my own
% %classes.
%
% I think that my interdisciplinary approach to research combining
% both numerical and experimental interests for electromagnetism together with
% my strong motivation coul interest you. I believe that my expertise in computational
% photonics and my understanding of the concepts of transformation optics is relevant for the QUEST project.
% I would enjoy discussing a
% potential postdoctoral position with you in the weeks to come. In
% the meantime, I am enclosing my Curriculum Vitae. If you require any additional materials
% or information, I am happy to supply it. Thank you very much for
% your consideration.

Yours sincerely,\\[1.5em]
