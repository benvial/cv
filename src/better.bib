 abstract = {The design of photonic devices is usually done through analytical modeling or variation in geometry and material parameters to obtain the required functionalities. Here, we report the use of topology optimization to obtain a bi-focal lens that concentrates the electromagnetic field at different spatial positions depending on the wavelength. Numerical inverse design is carried out to obtain the permittivity layout, satisfying this objective. The resulting device is then 3D printed using two low-loss dielectrics, and experimental field mapping at microwaves demonstrates the ability to enhance the field locally at distinct locations for two separate frequencies.},

 abstract = {Composites with subwavelength features exhibit effective properties that depend on microstructure morphology and materials, which can be adjusted to obtain enhanced characteristics. We detail the systematic design of electromagnetic metamaterials composed of dielectric inclusions in a ferroelectric matrix that, under an applied voltage, present an optimized effective tunability higher than the bulk due to a nonlinear local electric field enhancement. The effect of volume fraction, losses, and biasing field on homogenized properties is investigated and the analysis of the photonic band diagram is carried out, providing the frequency dependence of the anisotropic effective index and tunability. Such metaceramics can be used in microwave antennas and components with higher reconfigurability and reduced power consumption.},

 abstract = {We present a modal analysis of metal/insulator/metal (MIM)-based metamaterials in the far infrared region. These structures can be used as resonant reflection bandcut spectral filters that are independent of the polarization and direction of incidence. We show that this resonant reflection dip is due to the excitation of quasimodes (modes associated with a complex frequency) leading to quasi-total absorption. We have fabricated large area samples made of chromium nanorod gratings on top of Si/Cr layers deposited on silicon substrate. Measurements by Fourier transform spectrophotometry show good agreement with finite element simulations. A quasimodal expansion method is applied to obtain a minimal resonant model that fits well full wave simulations and that highlights excitation conditions of the modes.},

With a properly tailored co-ordinate stretching depending both on the incident field and on grating parameters, the APML may efficiently absorb diffracted orders near grazing angles (the so-called Wood's anomalies). The new design is implemented in a finite element method (FEM) scheme and applied on a numerical example of a dielectric slit grating. Its performances are compared with classical PML with constant stretching coefficient.},
